# YT-2-Stems

**YT‚Äë2‚ÄëStems** lets you drop in any song (or paste a YouTube/SoundCloud link) and instantly get clean vocal, drum, bass, and other stems‚Äîplus its BPM and musical key.  
It wraps state‚Äëof‚Äëthe‚Äëart **machine‚Äëlearning models** (Demucs for stem separation and Essentia for tempo/key analysis) in a one‚Äëwindow Python GUI.

A cross-platform Python GUI that:

1. **Downloads** audio from **YouTube or SoundCloud** via `yt-dlp` ‚Äì or lets you drag-and-drop / select a local file.  
2. **Transcodes** to MP3 at the bitrate you choose (FFmpeg).  
3. **Splits** the track into stems with **Demucs v4** (choose any model; 2-stem or full).  
4. **Analyzes** the original track's **tempo (BPM)** and **musical key** using **Essentia**.  
5. Shows a live **progress bar** and detailed log.

Result: a folder of stems (vocals, drums, bass, other, etc.) plus BPM + key read-outs.
